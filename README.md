# Simple Website to Sum money values in a block of text

While researching climbing gear, I found many forum posts with unorganized lists of gear and prices. I wanted to be able to quickly sum up the total cost of the gear in the post. This website allows you to paste in a block of text, and it will sum up all the money values in the text.


## Limitations:
ACCEPTABLE VALUE:
- `$199`
- `$1.99`

NOT ACCEPTABLE VALUE:
- `$1,000`
- `$1,000.00`
- `$ 1.00`



### sample text
from [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/93hko4/comment/e3dmu9j/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)



```Steep and cheap. / $30 wild country rocks 1-8/ $53 dmm offsets/ $464. Dmm dragon 2s. 8 cams (Bd .3-4 equivalent)/ $10 nut tool

Mtnoutlet.com $50 10 shoulder length slings $20 2 double length slings

Gear express $150 30 nonlockers $26. 4 small lockers

So $800 added onto your sport gear of draws, belay device, harness, shoes, chalkbag. This gets you a "minimal single rack". After about 1 year with this you'd probably want to add

Backcountry $730 camalot package .3-#6 $120 offset brass nuts $100 black totem $25. Pink tricam

This gets you to a full fledged rack and will get you up durn near everything.
```


I would adjust and remove the line that contains $800 for my use. or just remove the "$" to ignore the value.
